# Timestamp Microservice

The Timestamp Microservice is a simple and lightweight API that converts Unix timestamps and natural language dates into standardized date and time formats. It accepts a timestamp in either Unix format (seconds since January 1, 1970) or a natural language date (e.g., "January 1, 2022") and returns the corresponding date and time in both Unix and UTC formats. This microservice is useful for developers working with timestamps and date conversions, as well as for anyone looking to quickly convert dates between different formats. Simplify your date and time calculations with the Timestamp Microservice.
